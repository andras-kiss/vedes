dear ladies and gm

its my pleasure to be here

its really humbling for me to talk about my SECM study in a conference opened by the inventor of the technique, prof AJB, and with all the important figures contributing to this technique here in the audience

so, aaaa, its very humbling, im actually a bit nervous so please forgive me if im start making not too much sense

aaaa, im doing my phd at the university of pécs in hungary, at the dgpc

our electrochemistry rs group is lead by my supervisor, prof nagy
im sure many of you know him from the book on SECM, and conferences like this, and ofc from the countless research papers

our rs group is quite small, besides prof nagy the other three members are LN, OZSE, and myself, András Kiss

I focus on the potentiometric operation of the SECM

I would like talk about the potentiometric operation briefly.
its a scanning technique, we have one measuring electrode, and we are moving this probe to cover all the data aquisition points of a 2D raster pattern above the target of interest, while measuring the potential at each point to construct an image

early on when I started to work with the technique I realized there was one fundamental issue with it, which is a lot bigger issue here than in the amperometric mode and it has to do with the response time of the potentiometric cell



if we are scanning above a radially symmetric target such as this one, we should get an image like this. perfectly symmetric, resembling the circular character of the target, because it actually creates a hemispherical concentration disrtibution

but instead of this, we get

this.
